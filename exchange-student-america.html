<p>Now i'm an exchange student from Egypt and I just came to America this year. It's really important to go to other countries by yourself. It can important because it really helps to make you responsible in your daily life. Yet to be responsible you have to take the good part and the bad part, too. Exchange students call the bad part "ESP. " "ESP" is short for "exchange student problems.</p>

<p>Exchange students travel off their countries to other countries to a new lot of things they could never have heard about before. They wish to know the way people in the other countries think, the between their countries and the others in the world, and how they live. They also wish to correct some incorrect information that the people in the other countries think about their country or their religion. These types of students travel to other countries when they are young because when they get older they might have important jobs. Exchange students are important because they can help create better understanding between the countries. Maybe someday this may stop wars between countries.</p>

<p>Unfortunately exchange students have some problems in their host countries, like difficulties with schools, with number families, with the terminology, homesickness, cultural shock, <a href="http://www.mbbyks.com/" title="lirik lagu" alt="lirik" rel="dofollow">lirik lagu</a> and other things. One big problem I have in school is I was often late to college. In the U. S i9000. my school commences at 7: 25 a. meters. but I am used to waking up for my school in Egypt around 8: 00 a. m. It's too hard for me to awaken at 6: 30 a. m. here. I think I went to the school just several times on time. I think my grades will drop because I am always late, however I need these grades to move this year because, even though I will take this year again in Egypt, I can't are unsuccessful this year here because I'm on a program called YES program (Youth Exchange and Study program) and they would give me a major punishment. Generally there are some exchange students who are doing very well in the educational institutions, but others stay doing homework all the morning, then study for tests, then go to sleep. "I hate the school here because they offer me a lot of homework and I feel that Now i'm wasting my time like that, " one Silk exchange student said. Exchange students must also see other people and speak to them. If they will get good grades, but then return home without the experience, only good grades, then the experience isn't the best for them.
Several exchange students have problems in finding good sponsor families. "I changed my family four times because they weren't a 'host' family, nevertheless they were a 'welcome' family, " Bedo Elsayed said. Bedo discussed that a "welcome" family wants to try to be "host" family, but not for some time, just for days or maybe several weeks.</p>

<p>Some exchange students would want to have a job, however they need permission for this job and it's way too hard to get this authorization to them from the federal government. To help us with spending money, Egyptian exchange students get about $125 from the program each month. But a great deal of exchange students want the government to provide them the permission to work because they want to earn more income and also they don't want to be determined by somebody else. "It's really important for all of us. We all could feel completely dependable in everything, " said Wafa Ali, an exchange student from Egypt.</p>

                    <p><img src='http://s22.postimg.org/yd9vk41kx/College_Student_Thumbs_Up_e1440734712137.jpg' border='0' alt='postimage'/></a></p>
                    
<p>Rather they have to work at jobs like babysitting, cleaning snow, cutting lawn so they can take cash money from it. But it's also hard for them to get these jobs and really sometimes hard to do them if some results in being a job. Nermeen Mahmoud, an exchange student from Egypt, tried babysitting only one time, but she found that it's not the same as in Egypt. "It's totally different. I will never do it again here, " she said. Because exchange students have a lot of problems, the exchange programs have a lot of volunteers who help the exchange students to solve their problems. The volunteers help a lot of exchange students in a great deal of problems. It's impossible to allow them to solve all of the problems, nevertheless they can help the student understand them and deal with them. Oksana, an exchange student from the Ukraine, tries to solve her problems by herself. "All the exchange students recognized before, that they were going to acquire problems, so they have to adapt with everything here and solve their problems on their own, " she said. Oksana had a lot of problems here in America. "I used to see a gloomy face from my 14-year-old host sis everyday, " she said, but she learned how to live with it.</p>

<p>Although there are problems, exchange programs are really important for everyone and some Egyptian exchange students hope to be web host brothers or sisters for an exchange student from America. "My own family in Egypt is hosting a girl from Swiss, " Aya Ashraf said.</p>

<p>For me, I want to be considered a host sibling for a north american person because now I actually have experience in the problems of exchange students, so I'll know that person's problems and I am going to be able to help him or her. With all of their problems, exchange student programs can still do good things for students and countries. Exchange students come to the U. S. with open minds so they listen to people and some of those change a lot with their pondering. For me, I never liked Jewish people before, but now I have about three Jewish friends who may be best friends. Before I thought that every one of them were bad people, but I found out which i was wrong.</p>
